# slot-machine-using-node.js

This is a simple slot machine built using Node.js, following a tutorial by Tech With Tim. The program runs in the terminal and simulates a basic slot machine game.

I’m planning to upgrade this project by:
✅ Converting it into a web-based version using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so it runs in the browser instead of the terminal.
✅ Adding a better UI to make it more interactive and visually appealing.
✅ Implementing sound effects and animations for a more engaging experience.
